### Assignment 1

e) **Does the change in population size between 40 and 100 make a difference between 40 and 100 cities? Explain and justify your answer. Depending on your answer, decide on the ideal population size for the remainder of your experiments.**

When you increase the population it appears that the lower the fvalue will be. Since a lower fvalue is good in this case. It also seems that the number seems to decrease with a large amount of varibales. We can see this in the 40 cities 40 population size with an average of 5.03 compared to 40 cities and 100 population with an average of 4.92. And we can see it with 100 cities and 40 population size with an average of 13.78 compared to 100 cities and 100 population with an average fvalue of 10.57. More than 3 units lower. Judging by these results a higher population size is better so I will now use a population size of 100.

g) **What is the best scaling method? Justify and explain your answer. Depending on your answer, decide on the ideal scaling method for the remainder of your experiments. You may need to use averages here as the method of comparison to identify whether changes lead to better or worse results.**
The best scaling method seems to the defautt scaling method rank. It average for 40 and 100 cities was 4.92 and 10.57 are lower than proportional with 5.21 and 10.5 respectiviely. It is also lower than top scaling method, which has 5.0 and 12.5. THis makes it the best scaling methd. I will continue using the Rank scaling method from now on.

h) **Do the changes in selection method make a difference? Explain and justify your answer.Depending on your answer, decide on the ideal selection method for the remainder of your experiments. Again, you may need to use averages here to identify differences** The difference between the selection methods are not that great. However it appears that the scholastic method is the best. With an average fvalue of 4,915.26
and 10,567.02. Routlette isn't far off with 4924.61 and 10938.10. So is tournament with an average of fvalue for 40 cities at 4940.08647 and 100 cities at 10721.67947.

i) **Does the change in the number of generations make a difference? Explain and justify your answer. Depending on your answer, decide on the ideal number of generations for the remainder of your experiments. You may need to use averages here to identify differences.**
On the smaller network of 40 cities. The difference was smaller with the of 4915.264229 and for 100 cities of 10567.01772 cities. COmpare this with the 1000 generations simulation 4901.175198 generations, which isn't that much of a difference for the smaller network. This number decrease a lot for the 100 cities, 8926.412367
which is atleast a difference of 1640km, which can make a big difference. THis makes it seem like for the larger networks we can use more generations are better.

Parameters decided on
- 100 Population SIze
- Rank Scaling Method
- Stochastic selection method.
- 1000 max number of generations.
